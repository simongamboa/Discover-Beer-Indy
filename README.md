# Discover-Beer-Indy

This is a console app I built using the .Net framework. It was good practice for C# fundamentals including methods, strings, loops, and 'if' logic. Check it out and let me know what you think. If you're a beer drinker, you may even discover something new. 

This repository contains the code on a .CS file for easy viewing. I have also attached a .exe file that contains the program.
